## What is TrueNAS ?

TrueNAS is network-attached storage software that allows you to use commodity hardware. It is an effective tool for organizing and storing digital files, including images, videos, and documents.

It’s a family of open-source, free network-attached storage (NAS) operating systems built by iXsystems that use the OpenZFS file system and are based on Linux and FreeBSD. It is licensed under the terms of the BSD License and runs on commodity x86–64 hardware. The TrueNAS range includes free public versions (TrueNAS Core, previously known as FreeNAS), commercial versions (TrueNAS Enterprise), and Linux versions (TrueNAS SCALE). TrueNAS uses the SMB, AFP, NFS, iSCSI, SSH, rsync, and FTP/TFTP protocols to support clients running Windows, macOS, and Unix as well as a variety of virtualization hosts, including XenServer and VMware.

TrueNAS is managed through a comprehensive web interface that handles essential administrative functions. The web interface supports storage pool configuration, user management, sharing configuration, and system maintenance.

TrueNAS is like a digital home for your files, keeping them secure and ready whenever you need them.
